 * Challenge Yourselph - 032
 * Wrapping Paper
 *
 * The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order for more. They have a list of the dimensions (length l, width w, and height h)
 * of each present, and only want to order exactly as much as they need.
 *
 * Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect right rectangular prism), which makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each gift a little easier:
 * find the surface area of the box, which is 2 * l * w + 2 * w * h + 2 * h * l. The elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the
 * smallest side.
 *
 * For example:
 *  - A present with dimensions 2x3x4 requires 2 * 6 + 2 * 12 + 2 * 8 = 52 square feet of wrapping paper plus 6 square feet of slack, for a total of 58 square feet.
 *  - A present with dimensions 1x1x10 requires 2 * 1 + 2 * 10 + 2 * 10 = 42 square feet of wrapping paper plus 1 square foot of slack, for a total of 43 square feet.
 *
 * All numbers in the elvesâ€™ list are in feet. How many total square feet of wrapping paper should they order?
 *
 * Usage:
 *  php calculate-wrapping-paper.php
 *  php calculate-wrapping-paper.php -v
 *  php calculate-wrapping-paper.php -f box-sizes.txt
